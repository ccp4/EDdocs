### Available multislice simulation softwares : 

The main reference for this method is the [book](#https://rd.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4419-6533-2)
*Advanced computing in electron microscopy, Kirkland, 2010* which is behind
the package [TEMSIM](#https://github.com/jhgorse/kirkland/tree/master/temsim).
The method is also available on these opensource [softwares](/notes/multislice_EM_softwares).

----------|-------------|---------- |       
[TEMSIM](#https://github.com/jhgorse/kirkland/tree/master/temsim)           | E. Kirkland    | 1988,2010 | compiled,Doc=Book_expensive
[NCEMSS/EDM](http://www.numis.northwestern.edu/edm/documentation/ncemss.htm)    | O' Keefe       |           | No longer developed,Doc+install available but not straightforward,electron direct method, might be the same as ZMULT since subramanian is contributor
