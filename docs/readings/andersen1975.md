- linear APW : combines APW and OPW(pseudo-potential)
- LMTO : combines kkr, cellular and LCAO

## Intro :
- judicious choice of **exchange-correlation** => potentials reproduce transition-metals fermi surfaces 0.01Ry to measured values
- compute ground state props(magnetic moment, spectra, cohesive energies)
- simplifications lead cellular=>Spherical, OPW=>pseudopot, LCAO=>tight-binding
- energy independent APW => linear secular eq in energy
