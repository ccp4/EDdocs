- HRTEM(phase) + ED(VHR) => bacteriorhodopsin (Henderson1975)
- electron holography(Litche1986), convergent beam ED(Hoier1993) are other techniques

**EC advantages over X-ray**

- strong interaction => small crystals
- lens with magnets => imaging => phase
- electron density distribution(X-ray) vs electrostatic potential(elec)
- Combining EM and ED
   - defects, no periodicity => EM
   - Ed higher resolution, precession 3D ED => high quality data

**Future of Crystallography**

- Improved HR through-focus exit-wave reconstruction (Coene1992,1996)
- ED with high sampling frequency(large sampling with zero padding) allows iterative phase retrieval(Miao2002)
- Lens-aberration-corrected EM : spherical aberration(Haider1995)
- Ultrafast EM femtosec transition states(Nobel prize Zewail1999)

**Challenges**

- Answers :
    - What info about crystal in HRTEM and ED?
    - How extract info for structure analysis ?
    - How to obtain good data for ED ?
- Questions :
    - X-ray vs ED principles the same ?
    - multi-scattering and non-linear effects too problematic?
    - Phase problem in EC?

**Symmetry elements and effect in reciprocal space**

- mirror symmetry as projected through :
    - perp to m plane => cannot be seen
    - parallel to m plane => mirror or 2-fold rotation
    - parallel to m plane => glide plane=screw axis perpendicular to plane
- 2 fold as projected :
    - along the axis => centrosymmetric
    - perpendicular : miroir symmetry
- inversion : phase=0 if origin same as center of inversion (not always the case $p4_2/nmc$)
- screw axis,glide plane : systematic absences h+k=2n which may exist in ED
- centring : systematic absences h+k=2n+1
- Summary : find positions of unique atoms and apply symmetries



## Chap 3 : Crystal structure factors and symmetry

**Electrostatic potential and structure factors**

Structure factor and scattering factor are related by (kinematic) :

$F(hkl) = \sum_{j=1}^{N} f_j(hkl)\exp 2i\pi(\mathbf u\cdot\mathbf r )$

- $\mathbf u=h\mathbf a^{\star}+k\mathbf b^{\star}+l\mathbf c^{\star}$ reciprocal lattice vectors
- $\mathbf r_j=x_j\mathbf a+y_j\mathbf b + z_j\mathbf c$ is the position of atom $j$ in real space
- So that $\mathbf r_j\cdot\mathbf u = hx_j+ky_j+z_jl$
- $F(hkl)$ is the structure factor of the crystal
- $f_j(hkl)$ is the scattering factor of atom $j$

The potential and structure factor are relatedby the Born approximation :

$\Phi(\mathbf u) = \frac{\lambda}{\sigma\Omega}F(\mathbf u)$

- $\sigma=2\pi me\lambda/h^2 (V^{-1}A^{-1})$ interaction constant
- $\Omega$ the volume of the unit cell
- $\Phi$ the Fourier transform of the potential (V)
- $F$ the structure factor (A)

**Crystallo structure factor phase and atom positions**

HRTEM gives the projection in a plane perpendicular to the beam direction.
For example for a beam going in $\mathbf c$ direction the projection of the
potential in the $(xy)$ plane is :
\begin{eqnarray}
    \varphi_p(x,y)&=&\int_0^t\varphi(x,y,z)dz \\
                  &=&\frac{\sigma\Omega}{\lambda}\sum_{h,k} F(hk0)\cos(2\pi(hx+ky)-\phi_F(hk0))
\end{eqnarray}

- So that maximum of the potential(position of atoms) are expected at $h+k=2n$ when structure factor phase is zero.
- Planes 5,2,0 and -5,2,0 have same amplitude but opposite phases which is an effect if symmetry following rules in the ITCr
- Phase relations between symmetry related reflections are determined by the space group (see space group explorer `spg` on terminal)
- The projection pattern is created by the summing the contributions of the projected structure factor phases

**Amplitudes and phases of symmetry related reflections**

- Symmetry related reflections $\mathbf u'=\mathbf u\cdot\mathbf R $ different than equivalent positions $\mathbf x'=\mathbf R\cdot\mathbf x$
- Translation part seen for relative phases : $F(\mathbf u')=e^{-2i\pi\mathbf u\cdot\mathbf t}F(\mathbf u)$
- Symmetry related reflections have same amplitudes but may differ in phase if translations are involved
