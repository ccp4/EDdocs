# CCP4-ED


## Goals
Contribute to the CCP4 Advanced integrated approaches to macromolecular structure determination.
### WP4 BBSRC grant
- [] Use or develop electron diffraction simulation tools
- [] Simulate multiple scattering in macromolecular crystals including effects such as mosaicity and disorder
- [] Identify corrections opportunities at the scaling stage in DIALS

## News
### Latest
- [main report update](/documents/abstract.pdf)
- near-bragg double scattering

### Look ahead
- fix near-bragg double scattering
- literature on microED and ED data

### Last week
- [2 beam](/projects/multislice/multi2D/#2-beam-dynamical-diffraction) rocking curves with tilted runs (pendullosung thickness still an issue)  

### Questions
- Acta crystallographica template
- Integrate intensity with thickness average rocking curve and crystal thicknesses.
<!-- - libraries for bloch wave or FD simulator
- compare nearBragg with multislice : where does nanobragg fit in ?  
- reasonable accuracy in the corrections
- lyzozyme protein
- smv format : convert data to smv with nearBragg  
contains intensities, viewer does linear scale mapping  
- continuous rotation integration over steps# -->
