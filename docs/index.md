# CCP4-ED


## Goals
Contribute to the CCP4 Advanced integrated approaches to macromolecular structure determination.
### WP4 BBSRC grant
- Use or develop electron diffraction simulation tools
- Simulate multiple scattering in macromolecular crystals including effects such as mosaicity and disorder
- Identify corrections opportunities at the scaling stage in DIALS
### Resources
- [abstract of this work](/documents/abstract.pdf)
- [slides 2020-06-29.pdf](/documents/2020-01-29_WP2.pdf) and [Slides](/planning/2020-01-29_WP2.odp)
- [2020-07-17.pdf](/documents/2020-07_RALFT.pdf)
- [slides WG2 2020-07-30](/documents/2020-07_WG2.pdf)

## News
### Latest
- [2 beam](/projects/multislice/multi2D/#2-beam-dynamical-diffraction) rocking curves with tilted runs (pendullosung thickness still an issue)  
- [Document](/documents/abstract.pdf)

### Look ahead
- literature on microED and ED data

### Last week
- [comparison Holton](/projects/nearBragg/#comparison-with-holton) minor differences : solid_angle, pixel offset, X/Z reverse
- pyNearBragg [green vs Fresnel vs Fraunhofer](/projects/nearBragg/#path-length-estimate)

### Questions
- Acta crystallographica template
- Integrated intensity with thickness average rocking curve and crystal thicknesses. 
<!-- - libraries for bloch wave or FD simulator
- compare nearBragg with multislice : where does nanobragg fit in ?  
- reasonable accuracy in the corrections
- lyzozyme protein
- smv format : convert data to smv with nearBragg  
contains intensities, viewer does linear scale mapping  
- continuous rotation integration over steps# -->
