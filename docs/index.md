# CCP4-ED


## Goals
Contribute to the CCP4 Advanced integrated approaches to macromolecular structure determination.
### WP4 BBSRC grant
- [ ] Use or develop electron diffraction simulation tools
- [ ] Simulate multiple scattering in macromolecular crystals including effects such as mosaicity and disorder
- [ ] Identify corrections opportunities at the scaling stage in DIALS

### Questions
- Acta crystallographica template
- Integrate intensity with thickness average rocking curve and crystal thicknesses.

<!-- - libraries for bloch wave or FD simulator
- compare nearBragg with multislice : where does nanobragg fit in ?  
- reasonable accuracy in the corrections
- lyzozyme protein
- smv format : convert data to smv with nearBragg  
contains intensities, viewer does linear scale mapping  
- continuous rotation integration over steps# -->
