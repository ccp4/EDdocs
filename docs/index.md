# CCP4-ED

## Goals
Contribute to the CCP4 Advanced integrated approaches to macromolecular structure determination.

### WP4 BBSRC grant
- Use or develop electron diffraction simulation tools
- Simulate multiple scattering in macromolecular crystals including effects such as mosaicity and disorder
- Identify corrections opportunities at the scaling stage in DIALS

- [Abstract](/planning/abstract.pdf)
- [Presentation 2020-06-29.pdf](/planning/2020-01-29_WP2.pdf) and [Slides](/planning/2020-01-29_WP2.odp)
- [2020-07-17.pdf](/planning/2020-07_RALFT.pdf)
- [slides WG2 2020-07-30](/planning/2020-07_WG2.pdf)

## Latest


## Look ahead
- change the mathematical slides
- parameter landscape

- compare nearBragg with multislice : where does nanobragg fit in ?  
- reasonable accuracy in the corrections
- lyzozyme protein
- mosaicity papers + microED paper sizes
- smv format : convert data to smv with nearBragg  
contains intensities, viewer does linear scale mapping  
- continuous rotation integration over steps#



## Last week
- [comparison Holton](/projects/nearBragg/#comparison-with-holton) minor differences : solid_angle, pixel offset, X/Z reverse
- pyNearBragg [green vs Fresnel vs Fraunhofer](/projects/nearBragg/#path-length-estimate)

## Questions
- libraries for bloch wave or FD simulator
