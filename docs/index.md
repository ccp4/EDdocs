# CCP4-ED


## Goals
Contribute to the CCP4 Advanced integrated approaches to macromolecular structure determination.

### WP4 BBSRC grant
- Use or develop electron diffraction simulation tools
- Simulate multiple scattering in macromolecular crystals including effects such as mosaicity and disorder
- Identify corrections opportunities at the scaling stage in DIALS

- [Abstract](/planning/abstract.pdf)
- [Presentation 2020-06-29.pdf](/planning/2020-01-29_WP2.pdf) and [Slides](/planning/2020-01-29_WP2.odp)

## Latest
- multislice :
    - [tilts run](/projects/multislice/applications#tilts-run)
    - [angle run](/projects/multislice/applications#full-rotational-study)
- multislice vs Fresnel convolution
- [multi_2D](/projects/multislice/#multislice-2d)

## Look ahead
- CCP4 training : 28/07
- Scaling algorithm
- presentation RAL Friday

## Last week
- Collision approach : [ poisson distribution](/projects/dynamical_diffraction/#collision-approach)
- nearBragg  2nd path length attempt


## Questions
- molecular replacement : model comes from different space group  
- defects : affects dynamical diffraction more  
- Experimental ED for proteins established ? (100 PDB ED data):
    - yonekura membrane ED (not as good as X-ray but even then solved with ED )
    - technology not as advanced as X-ray
- Theoretical:
    - broad effect of dynamical diffraction can be corrected for improving structure determination
    - mosaicity ruled out
    - lattice bending (no systematic)
    - radiation damage
    - biotin(no solvent)
- eBIC : real data for biotin
