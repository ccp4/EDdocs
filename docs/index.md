# CCP4-ED

## Goals
Contribute to the CCP4 Advanced integrated approaches to macromolecular structure determination.

### WP4 BBSRC grant
- Use or develop electron diffraction simulation tools
- Simulate multiple scattering in macromolecular crystals including effects such as mosaicity and disorder
- Identify corrections opportunities at the scaling stage in DIALS



## Latest
- multislice vs Fresnel convolution
- nearBragg attempt
- Collision approach : [ poisson distribution](/projects/dynamical_diffraction/#collision-approach)

## Look ahead

## Last week
- nanobragg for mosaicity
- simulate biotin (using gemmi)
- Non ortho grid : reference in section 6.7 (book 1984)
    - Kirkland last edition
