# CCP4-ED

## Goals
Contribute to the CCP4 Advanced integrated approaches to macromolecular structure determination.

### WP4 BBSRC grant
- Use or develop electron diffraction simulation tools
- Simulate multiple scattering in macromolecular crystals including effects such as mosaicity and disorder
- Identify corrections opportunities at the scaling stage in DIALS
