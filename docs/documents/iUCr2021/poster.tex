\headerbox{Contribution}{name=contrib,span=1,column=0,row=0}{
We provide a comparison of the 2 most popular methods used for simulating electron diffraction(ED),
namely the multislice(MS) and blochwave(BW).

Dynamical diffraction is described by both methods while
advantages and limitations of both approaches are highlighted and discussed.

As proof of concept, the multislice method is subsequently used to reproduce a continuous rotation experiment
based on $\alpha$-glycine.

\headerbox{Motivations for ED simulations}{name=intro,span=1,column=0,below=contrib}{

Macromolecular structures can be solved from ED patterns using standard
macromolecular X-ray crystallographic(MX)
techniques.%~\cite{ShiNanenga2016}.

ED is attractive as it:
%
\begin{itemize}\compresslist
 \item Enables \highlight{solving structures from nanocrystals} due to the \emph{strong electron-atom interaction}.
 \item Produces \highlight{high resolution maps} due to the very \emph{small electronic wavelength 0.025$A$@200keV}.
 \item Resolves \highlight{atomic nucleus positions} through the \emph{electrostatic potential map}. %which is complementary to the electron density from X-ray diffraction.
\end{itemize}

However, \negCol{Rfactors obtained through ED remain larger than those of X-ray} due to a lack of theoretical understanding of \emph{dynamical diffraction}.

\begin{center}\textbf{Standard MX pipeline}\end{center}
\vspace{-2em}
\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{MX_t.png}
\end{center}
MX is based on the \emph{kinematic theory of diffraction} due to the
weak interaction between X-rays and the electron density.
Kinematic theory can not rigorously be applied to ED.

In ED, the structure factor is related to the electrostatic potential
through :
\begin{empheq}[box=\widecolourbox]{equation*}
	\frac{\dP\Psi(x,y,z)}{\dP_z} =
		\Big\{ \frac{i\lambda}{4\pi}\grad^2_{xy} + i\sigma V(x,y,z)\Big\}

200keV electrons have typical elastic mean free path of 200nm in organic atoms.
This results in an appreciable probability of multiple scattering in nanocrystals.

The main reflections are correctly predicted, although the patterns need to be rotated
in the plane of the figure to get an exact match. The reflection broadening is related to
finite size effects and window function of the padded domain.
