\section{Coupling coefficients}

The coupling coefficients involve the translational addition theorem
coefficients :
%
\begin{widetext}
\begin{equation*}
  a_{\nu,\mu;l,m}^{(out-in)}(d_{pq},\theta_{pq},\phi_{pq})
    = 4\pi\sum_{q=|l-\nu|}^{l+\nu}
       (-j)^{l-\nu-q}h_q^{(1)}(kd_{pq}) Y_q^{m-\mu}(\theta_{pq},\phi_{pq})
       (-1)^m \cc G(l,\nu,q, m,-\mu,\mu-m))
\end{equation*}
\end{widetext}
%
where :
%
\begin{equation*}
  \cc G(l_1,l_2,l_3,m_1,m_2,m_3) =
  \int_{\Omega}Y_{l_1}^{m_1}Y_{l_2}^{m_2}Y_{l_3}^{m_3}d\Omega
\end{equation*}
%
are the Gaunt coefficients
% (https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/functions/sage/functions/wigner.html)
and we have used :
%
\begin{equation*}
  \int_{\Omega}Y_{l}^{m}Y_{\nu}^{\mu*}Y_{q}^{m-\mu~*}d\Omega =
(-1)^{\mu-m-\mu}\int_{\Omega}Y_{l}^{m}Y_{\nu}^{-\mu}Y_{q}^{-m+\mu}d\Omega
\end{equation*}
