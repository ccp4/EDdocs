  Due to the strong electron-atom interaction, the kinematic theory of
  diffraction can not be used to describe the scattering of electrons by
  an assembly of atoms. Dynamical diffraction need to be taken into account
  by solving Schr{\"o}dinger's equation.
  In this paper, the scattering of high energy electrons by a regular array
  of light atoms is solved exactly using the T-matrix in spherical coordinates.
  Using the independent atom model, each atom is represented by a sphere with an
  effective constant potential.
  The validity of the forward scattering approximation and the phase grating
  approximation assumed by the popular multislice method are discussed.
  An interpretation of multiple scattering is proposed and compared with existing
  interpretations.
