# week 04
## Monday
- [x] Bloch wave development
- ireloh  
    - [ ] test some other orientations
    - [ ] excitation errors on zone axis
- multi2D :
    - [ ] lack of periodic boundary condition
    - [ ] redo the carbone integration study
- reading :
    - some papers on 3 and N beam dynamical diffraction


##TODO
- paper 2021
- simulate 10 different thicknesses integrated by integration software
normalize where the values with zero thickness (kinematic regime)
