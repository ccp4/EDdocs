## Thursday
- reading
    - [ ] VanDyck1995
- ireloh  
    - [ ] gemmi orientation pb : doc not enough info
    - [ ] test some other orientations
    - [ ] excitation errors on zone axis
- multi2D :
    - [ ] lack of periodic boundary condition
    - [ ] redo the carbon integration study
- Bloch wave development : clean and compare to ms2d


##TODO

- simulate 10 different thicknesses integrated by integration software
normalize where the values with zero thickness (kinematic regime)


- compare MULTEM with TEMSIM
