# week 22
## Monday
- bank holiday

## Tuesday
- meeting internship :
- blochwave jupy
- general architecture 


## TODO
### Bloch
- Test 2-beam rocking curve, thickness dependence  
- simulate Silicon/Glycine orientations
- integrate into pets
- jupyter example

### Christine's internship
  - [x] install pyscat locally
  - [x] git tutorial
  - assignment
    - code architecture
    <!-- - implement flux in compute_f(optional) -->
    - implement arbitrary distance in linear array

### Glycine
- glycine padding study
- extract info from jana compare with multislice
- compare MULTEM with TEMSIM - Glycine
- mosaicity and rocking

jupy :
    - multi_2D
    - TDS, partial coherency,
    - blochwave

speculation based on physical simulations
NB vs multislice
Thickness
structure solution from numerical simulation data

### multi2D
  - [ ] no periodic boundary condition
  - [ ] integration study(on 3 beam configuration) --Rfactor
  - [ ] elaborate on bonding effect in the multislice 2D
  - [ ] partial coherency
  - [ ] inelastic scattering
###others
  - pattern every 20 slices
  - [ ] clean code
  - [ ] run simulation 1935-1945 and tilt simulation
  - [ ] excitation errors on zone axis

- multi2D :
  - [ ] redo the carbon integration study
- Bloch wave development : clean and compare to ms2d

- [ ] clean website
- ireloh :
  - find excitation errors for ireloh
  - zone axis image
  - find centre of mass of crystal

- simulate 10 different thicknesses integrated by integration software
normalize where the values with zero thickness (kinematic regime)
- use TDS for the crystal
