# week 23
## Monday
- viewers
- meeting christine

## Tuesday
- include mutli in viewers  EDutils.Viewer
- base class for ED simulators
- blochwave jupy



## TODO
### Bloch
- Test 2-beam rocking curve, thickness dependence  
- simulate Silicon/Glycine orientations
- integrate into pets
- jupyter example

### Christine's internship assignments
- [x] Integrate custom spherical harmonics in compute_f
- Implement arbitrary distance in linear array and show examples
- Exercise on using the translation theorem


### Glycine
- glycine padding study
- extract info from jana compare with multislice
- compare MULTEM with TEMSIM - Glycine
- mosaicity and rocking

jupy :
    - multi_2D
    - TDS, partial coherency,
    - blochwave

speculation based on physical simulations
NB vs multislice
Thickness
structure solution from numerical simulation data

### multi2D
  - [ ] no periodic boundary condition
  - [ ] integration study(on 3 beam configuration) --Rfactor
  - [ ] elaborate on bonding effect in the multislice 2D
  - [ ] partial coherency
  - [ ] inelastic scattering
###others
  - pattern every 20 slices
  - [ ] clean code
  - [ ] run simulation 1935-1945 and tilt simulation
  - [ ] excitation errors on zone axis

- multi2D :
  - [ ] redo the carbon integration study
- Bloch wave development : clean and compare to ms2d

- [ ] clean website
- ireloh :
  - find excitation errors for ireloh
  - zone axis image
  - find centre of mass of crystal

- simulate 10 different thicknesses integrated by integration software
normalize where the values with zero thickness (kinematic regime)
- use TDS for the crystal
