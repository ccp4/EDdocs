# week 04
## Monday
- reading
    - [x] Oleynikov2007 exp vs precessionED SAED with ms
- multi2D :
    - [x] fix Fresnel integral (factor e(jpi/4) in real space propagator needed!)

## Tuesday
- reading
    - [ ] VanDyck1995
- ireloh  
    - [ ] test some other orientations
    - [ ] excitation errors on zone axis
- multi2D :
    - [ ] lack of periodic boundary condition
    - [ ] redo the carbon integration study

- Bloch wave development : clean and compare to ms2d

##TODO

- simulate 10 different thicknesses integrated by integration software
normalize where the values with zero thickness (kinematic regime)
