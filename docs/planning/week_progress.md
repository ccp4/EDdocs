## Monday


## Friday
install the setup scripts with jupyter
  - [x] test jupyter


near bragg rerun dual scattering  
elaborate on bonding effect in the multislice 2D
Focus on the Thermal diffuse scattering
Exploring random shift myself




# week 11
## Monday

## Tuesday
- comparison padding 3D

## Wednesday
- [x] git branch conflicts
- padding study 2D relative beam intensities integration
- artificially reduce potential strength temsim

## Friday

##TODO
  - pattern every 20 slices
  - [ ] clean code
  - [ ] run simulation 1935-1945 and tilt simulation
  - [ ] excitation errors on zone axis

- multi2D :
  - [ ] no periodic boundary condition
  - [ ] redo the carbon integration study
- Bloch wave development : clean and compare to ms2d
- compare MULTEM with TEMSIM
- [ ] clean website
- ireloh :
  - find excitation errors for ireloh
  - zone axis image
  - find centre of mass of crystal

- simulate 10 different thicknesses integrated by integration software
normalize where the values with zero thickness (kinematic regime)
- use TDS for the crystal
