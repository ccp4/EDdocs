# week  49
## Monday
- [x] multislice linear array
    - simu ok
- neat gui qdot scattering

## Tuesday
- [x] near Bragg
  - implemented and run but too much scattering
  - document on website
- [x] kinematic check with qdot scattering sphere

## Wednesday
- [x] multislice single qdot sphere weak phase approx (seems ok)

## Thursday
- [x] single sphere find radius/pots such that multi shells fs approx Coulomb for Carbon (Born approx not good or too many shells needed)

## Friday
- multislice linear arrray:
    - run py multislice3D for qdot atompot
    - implement 2 qdot spheres exact
    - 2-qdot mutlislice3D


- read new material
    - cowley1968 summary
    - cowley2010 inelastic scattering
