# week 27
## Monday
- diamond integration (2-beam, 3-beam, zone-axis with/without weak beams)
- [ ] Glycine generate full exp with Bloch and postprocess

- import dials experiment
- git alias ...


- Iobs vs Icalc, Q-Qplot dynamic thickness vs Kinematic
different types of configurations


## TODO
### Christine's internship assignments
- issue#1 Integrate custom spherical harmonics in compute_f
- issue#2 Implement arbitrary distance in linear array and show examples
- issue#3 Exercise on using the translation theorem

### viewers :
  - command search
  - multislice clean patterns files finding
  - hkl click

### Glycine
- glycine padding study
- extract info from jana compare with multislice
- compare MULTEM with TEMSIM - Glycine
- mosaicity and rocking

jupy :
    - multi_2D
    - TDS, partial coherency,
    - blochwave

speculation based on physical simulations
NB vs multislice
Thickness
structure solution from numerical simulation data

### multi2D
  - [ ] no periodic boundary condition
  - [ ] integration study(on 3 beam configuration) --Rfactor
  - [ ] elaborate on bonding effect in the multislice 2D
  - [ ] partial coherency
  - [ ] inelastic scattering
###others
  - pattern every 20 slices
  - [ ] clean code
  - [ ] run simulation 1935-1945 and tilt simulation


- [ ] clean website
- ireloh :
  - find excitation errors for ireloh
  - zone axis image
  - find centre of mass of crystal

- simulate 10 different thicknesses integrated by integration software
normalize where the values with zero thickness (kinematic regime)
- use TDS for the crystal
