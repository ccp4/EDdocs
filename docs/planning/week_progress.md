# week 09
## Monday
  - [ ] run simulation 1935-1945 and tilt simulation
  - [ ] excitation errors on zone axis
- multi2D :
  - [ ] no periodic boundary condition
  - [ ] redo the carbon integration study
- Bloch wave development : clean and compare to ms2d
- compare MULTEM with TEMSIM
- [ ] clean website

##TODO
- simulate 10 different thicknesses integrated by integration software
normalize where the values with zero thickness (kinematic regime)

API SF/CC 20W50 oscaro

find excitation errors for ireloh
zone axis image
find center of mass of crystal
