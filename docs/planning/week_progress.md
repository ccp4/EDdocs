## Tuesday
- presentation diffraction methods

## Wednesday
- presentation
- review 2sphere approx

## Thursday
- prepare epicza/ireloh simu :
    - [x] load structure
    - [x] compute structure factor F
    - [ ] compute transmission function T
    - [ ] run zone axis simu and get diff pattern P
    - [ ] prepare fo vs fc plot for F,T,P

- paper 2021
- simulate 10 different thicknesses integrated by integration software
normalize where the values with zero thickness (kinematic regime)
