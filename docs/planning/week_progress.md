#week 45
## Monday
- implement translational addition theorem vector
- vector spherical harmonics documentation found ref errors
- hamid1990 solve system
## Tuesday
- compare RCS with single sphere


## TODO
- readings :
- multi_2D
    - Bloch
    - BPM/FD with periodic boundary conditions
    - Redo 2-beam Iq at the exact Bragg condition.
    - Redo rocking curves with proper label
    - redo zeta_g, labels h=1,2
- Multislice :
    - biotin
        - run and compare 100+10, 101
        - TDS get wobble parameters
    - Development
        - Documentation with sphinx
        - embedded C
        - smv format
        - multithread fft, no openMP,  no--enable-float
        - solvent scattering
        - defects vacancy, bending, TDS
      - lyzozyme
- misc
  - 1 thread per simulation flag
      - Implement multithreads access to fftw
      - Force 1 thread on splines?
