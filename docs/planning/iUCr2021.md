# iUCr2021

## Sunday 15/08/2021
- Spin resolved charge density and wave function refinements
  - Nicolas Claiser,CRM2 laboratory a new software: Mollynx
  - Faculte des sciences de lorraine

## Monday
- Nannenga : MicroED and GIWAXS
- Pisa 3D ED data (enrico mugnaioli):
    - 3D ED data review gemmi
    - drift sample during CED
    - Nanobeam ED where only a small beam is illuminates the sample
    - advantage of stepwise full control of where data  is collected(select new areas if damage appears but long, large range 100deg)
    - PED much better quality
    - Terrylene structure solved => Jana 16.4%
    - kentax2 => C46H30 (NMR was failing )
    - Orthocetamol => C8H9NO2 structure hard to solve(bad datasets twinnings), hydrogen resolved
    - Linagliptin (diabetes): solution by SIR
    - olanzapine (szysophrenia)
- Ruiz : Crystal structure determination of organic dye with triclinic by ED
    - Fst-ADT (automated diffraction tomography) : diffraction patterns at different tilts
    - DRED1 (C16H18N4O3) beam sensitive
    - Ultramicroscopy,vol 211, 112951
    - water not expected, solved with jana2006  (P1 and P-1 possible space group)
    - double-peaked curve fitting on rocking curves !!
- Barbara Gruza : Refinement with multipolar scattering factors
    - Changing structure factors to IAM, Hans-Coppens Multipole model
    - TAAM(Transferable Aspherical Atom Model) based on MATTS databank (olex to refine)
    - difference mostly at higher resolutions !!!
- Taimin Yang: Improving data quality
    - energy filter removes lot of noise (remarkable differences )
    - filtering with slits
    - in STEM mode HAADF can be collected simultaneously (for crystal tracking )
    - Extinction in x-ray crystallography : EXTI : Fc^2 k^2/sqrt(1+0.01Fc^2lam^3x/sin(2theta))
    - ZSM-5 example

###14:45 Recent advances in Electron crystallography
- Ding Peng : QCBED-DFT
    - IAM for SF and QCBED, blochwave to simulate patterns
    - charge density glues DFT to QCBED : DFT-> rho ->QCBED refinement ->E_{xc} and R->DFT
    - QCBED-DFT algo : Xi2 to optimize parameters in blochwave, avoid local minima
    - NiO and CeB6 : Blochwave code shared by jian-min zuo
    - Peng nakashima Phys rev letter 126,176402
    - zone axis : low order more sensitive to the material
- Weilun Li : Direct imaging of metal additivies on Au Nanocirve surfaces

### meeting with JAR and Ambarneli
- JAR started his own group after time with Tamir : kept connection with ED
- ACA microED sessions
- John Spence, nano-beams to check lattice(variations) orientation misalignment(rigid)
- tomogram reconstruction of the crystal with 10nm thickness, 20-40nm scale(thickness at every point)
- PRISM, plasticity not accounted for by perfect models
- Energy filtering unsure yet whether that makes it better(they re gonna have a good beam)
- Serial approach, unit cell variation
